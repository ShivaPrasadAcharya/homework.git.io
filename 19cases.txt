presumption of constitutionality

2. Navtej Singh Johar v. Union of India (2018)
भारतीय दण्ड संहिताको धारा 377 (समलिङ्गी सम्बन्धलाई अपराध मान्ने) को संवैधानिकता परीक्षण गर्दा, सर्वोच्च अदालतले उक्त धाराको आंशिक रूपमा असंवैधानिक घोषित गर्‍यो। न्यायमूर्ति D.Y. Chandrachud ले आफ्नो फैसलामा लेखे:
"जहाँ मौलिक अधिकारहरूको संरक्षणको प्रश्न आउँछ, त्यहाँ शङ्काको सुविधा कानूनलाई होइन, मौलिक अधिकारहरूलाई दिइनुपर्छ। अन्यथा संविधानवादको आधारभूत उद्देश्य नै पराजित हुन्छ।"

3. Shreya Singhal v. Union of India (2015)
सूचना प्रविधि ऐनको धारा 66A लाई असंवैधानिक घोषित गर्दै सर्वोच्च अदालतले भन्यो:
"अभिव्यक्ति स्वतन्त्रताजस्ता मौलिक अधिकारहरूलाई सीमित गर्ने कानूनहरूको संवैधानिकता परीक्षणमा शङ्काको सुविधा कानूनलाई दिने परम्परागत सिद्धान्त लागू हुँदैन। बरु, यस्ता कानूनहरू अति संकीर्ण (narrowly tailored) छन् भन्ने प्रमाणको भार राज्यमा रहन्छ।"

4. Justice K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India (2017)
निजताको अधिकारसम्बन्धी यस ऐतिहासिक फैसलामा सर्वोच्च अदालतको 9-सदस्यीय संवैधानिक इजलासले भन्यो:
"मौलिक अधिकारहरूको विषयमा शङ्काको सुविधा कानूनलाई होइन, नागरिकको अधिकारलाई दिइनुपर्छ। राज्यले अधिकारमाथि लगाइएको प्रतिबन्ध आवश्यक र आनुपातिक छ भन्ने प्रमाणित गर्नुपर्छ।"


Doctrine of progressive realization of rights

2. Navtej Singh Johar v. Union of India (2018):
it must be noted that the presumption of constitutionality is merely an evidentiary burden initially on the person seeking to challenge the vires of a statute and once any violation of fundamental rights or suspect classification is prima facie shown, then such presumption has no role.


MInerava Mills : FR and DPSP be given equal weightage. DPSP cannot be given more weightage than FR.
The Supreme Court has consistently held that DPSPs cannot override fundamental rights or other constitutional provisions.

The Supreme Court has evolved the doctrine of harmonious construction, especially after the Minerva Mills case (1980), which establishes that fundamental rights and DPSPs complement each other rather than being in tension.

Interpretative Value: Courts use DPSPs as interpretative tools. When a law admits multiple interpretations, courts prefer the interpretation that advances DPSPs.

are examples from around the world where development projects or hotels were withdrawn from conservation areas due to court orders:
