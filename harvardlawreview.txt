Ananda Mohan Bhattarai•, Shreya Sanjel and Pranjali Kanel
Abstract
Nepal, a small country in the Himalaya, is home to diverse ecosystems. It has acclimatized and braved significant environmental challenges. Over decades, Nepal has had to navigate through issues ranging from natural disasters to pollution and challenges of forest and biodiversity protection amid rapid infrastructure development. With a promising framework of rights in the midst of enormous environmental challenges, how is Nepal steering its path of inclusive democracy envisioned in the 2015 Constitution? Does it have some story to tell the world about people realizing human rights while traversing the journey of environmentally sustainable development? This paper accounts for the environmental challenges faced by Nepal, and the role played by the judiciary, revealed through case law, in protecting the people and environment and promoting environmental constitutionalism in Nepal. It draws a few messages relevant to the academics and practitioners of environmental justice that justify taking Nepal as a special case in the current environment and human rights discourse.   

Introduction 
Nepal's geographical intricacies, rich culture, historical civilization, and diverse population bewilder many. Physiographically characterized as a Himalayan nation,  Nepal, a small country,   inhabits a relatively large population.  Climate change has exacerbated environmental challenges in Nepal  and made lives and livelihoods difficult. Many of these challenges go beyond the capacity and competence of the state. Within the limits of its human and material resources, Nepal is trying to address these challenges through an inclusive and rights-focused constitutional system. The paper assesses Nepal's efforts in this regard, specifically delving into the role of the judiciary in advancing environmentally sustainable development from a human rights-based approach. 
The paper begins with an introduction to Nepal in light of its intricate geographical and ecological features. It explores how these features lead to challenges that transcend ecological concerns to encompass pervasive human rights issues. Section II transitions to the international context, exploring the nexus between human rights and the environment. It delves into the recognition of environment right as a human right, examining the emergence of soft laws and global initiatives acknowledging this relationship. Section III returns to Nepal, tracing its constitutional journey as it progresses toward democracy and inclusivity. The 2015 Constitution of Nepal emerges as a landmark in this constitutional transition. It provides a comprehensive framework for environmental sustainability, and enforceable human rights. In section IV, the paper examines the role of the judiciary in protecting environment and human rights. This section explores selected judgments to highlight the judiciary's approach and jurisprudence based on constitutional vision and guarantees. Section V provides an overview of the discussed cases and judicial efforts towards inclusive human rights protection and sustainable use of environmental resources and their protection. Section VI presents the unique position occupied by this Himalayan nation to address the pressing present and emerging environmental concerns. It concludes by making a case about why these concerns and the nation's efforts and plights deserve ample international attention.
I.	Nepal and Environmental Challenges
The Himalaya region begins in the west at Nanga Parbat near the Indus Gorge (northern Pakistan) and ends in the east at Namche Barwa (Arunachal Pradesh, India). Nepal is almost exactly in the middle of this arch-shaped region. The width of the Himalaya in Nepal is attitudinally diverse, ranging from 150 to 300 kilometers.  Nepal's land area is structurally classified into the Trans-Himalaya, the main Himalaya, the middle mountains, and the Chure (Shiwalik). Within this, it encompasses alpine, temperate, subtropical, and tropical climatic zones. Numerous mountain ranges descend from the Himalaya on both north and south of the range. These mountains range from high to middle elevation before eventually leveling off into the lower-elevation Shiwalk Hills. The Indo-Gangetic flood plains lie south of the Shivalik range. Nepal's high mountains and hills are sparsely populated, while the main concentration of inhabitants lie in the southern plain areas.  Recently, there has been a significant rural-to-urban migration, reflecting a shift in occupation from agriculture to the non-agricultural sector.  
The Himalayan system is rich in biodiversity. The Eastern Himalaya, encompassing Nepal, Bhutan, and northeast India, hosts four out of the thirty-six global biodiversity hotspots.  Geomorphological configurations such as tectonically disturbed bedrock, steep slopes, and high altitudinal variation over short horizontal distances create varying climatic and geological conditions. These factors cause variation in the region’s biodiversity. The country faces challenges in maintaining ecological balance due to unreliable climatic patterns resulting in flash floods and forest fires. Recurring cloudbursts resulting in the collapse of glacial lakes at high altitudes, have caused substantial damage to downstream human settlements, properties, and infrastructures.  A study by the government of Nepal revealed that climate-induced disasters account for around 65 percent of annual disaster-related deaths.  The average annual economic loss from these disasters is approximately 0.08 percent of the GDP.  
Nepal's geographical and ecological position, coupled with its low Human Development Index (HDI)   and a multidimensional poverty rate of 17.5 percent,  provides ground for many socio-economic issues. The country is frequently impact of disasters, affecting areas such as food security, housing, infrastructures, health, and education. Mountain-specific poverty  and  disaster-induced forced migration are also a pressing matter. Disparities rooted in economic status, gender, socio-cultural factors, and geographical situatedness exacerbate these challenges for vulnerable groups -- impeding their realization of human rights and inclusivity. The trajectory of Nepal's constitutional evolution has progressively addressed these concerns with the aim to develop a more equitable and inclusive legal and societal structure.
II.	Constitutional Journey towards Democracy and Human Rights
Nepal's journey towards democracy has been long and tumultuous. Since its first constitution in 1948, the country has experimented with seven constitutions  reflecting Nepal's political and social evolution. The present constitution, adopted by the Constituent Assembly in 2015, embodies at least four significant transitions: the shift from monarchy to a republican system of government, the evolution from a Hindu state to secularism, the transition from a unitary system to federalism, and the progression from a monolithic state to an inclusive democracy.  
Among the seven constitutions drawn over the span of 75 years,  the sixth Constitution-the Interim Constitution of 2007,  marked a pivotal moment for Nepal. It significantly advanced inclusion, human rights and environmental protection. This Constitution provided a range of fundamental rights, emphasizing inclusivity through social justice and affirmative actions. For the first time it also recognized the right to clean environment, in conjunction with the right to health.  The subsequent Constitution of Nepal (2015) widened the range of fundamental rights by incorporating the rights of special groups.  It further consolidated environment right by placing it as a distinct entitlement.  Including environmental rights in the constitutional framework addressed the need for actionable measures and enforceability.  This aligned environmental rights with inclusivity, sustainability, and other fundamental rights. From this juncture, environmental constitutionalism has evolved parallel to the constitutional values, ideals, and principles that form the foundation of the Nepali constitutional order.
Nepal's constitutional journey diachronically presents three notable highlights, particularly visible from 1990 onwards. First, it reinforces the principle that the Constitution equally binds every individual, and facilitates the change of government through periodic elections. Second, it solidifies the judiciary's position, from a subsidiary element in the constitutional dynamics to a significant player. This evolution entrenches the Supreme Court's position as the final court of appeal and vests the power of judicial review within it. The Court functions on an access-to-justice model, exercising broad jurisdiction to entertain public interest petitions. This stands in contrast to taking a more restrictive approach, requiring high legal standing and having narrow jurisdiction. The third highlight is the proliferation of enforceable rights. The pre-1990 constitutions contained civil and political rights with limited enforceability. The 1990 Constitution departed from that by presenting a bold framework of rights, which the Interim Constitution (2007) further widened. The present Constitution of Nepal, introducing inclusive democracy, provides for at least thirty enforceable rights. These include civil, political, economic, social, and cultural rights, along with the rights of vulnerable groups such as Dalits, women, children, and senior citizens. For the first time, it also guarantees the "right to live in a clean and healthy environment"  as a separate enforceable fundamental right. This has encouraged more efforts from state and non-state actors for environment protection. Further, when intentional actions harm environmental health, the victims are entitled to compensation.  This adds practical vitality to this declaratory right. The Constitution also calls upon the state to strive towards realizing "environmentally sustainable development." 
Inclusive democracy promised in the present Constitution is a multidimensional concept. It includes political, social, economic, cultural, and ecological dimensions. Takis Fotopoulos calls inclusive democracy a "liberatory project."  Environmentally, inclusive democracy prevents the state from prioritizing the short-term economic interests of specific groups  while remaining indifferent to environmental and climatic devastation and its impact on public health. True to the call for inclusive democracy, the current Constitution embraces environmental sustainability, manifesting it as an enforceable right and a state policy. The Constitution explicitly encapsulates environmental principles of intergenerational equity, polluter pays, prior informed consent, and the precautionary principle.  It also provides guidelines for the protection and use of natural resources helping the state to prioritize and pursue principles of environmentally sustainable development.  
III.	The Nexus between Human Rights and the Environment
Human rights play a crucial role in safeguarding the environment, both substantively and procedurally.  A clean and healthy environment not only upholds environmental rights but also enables the effective realization of other rights. The evolving interplay between human rights and the environment is evident in the idea that "environmental harm interferes with the enjoyment of human rights and the exercise of human rights helps to protect the environment."  
Tracing the link between the environment and human rights in international law, the Stockholm Declaration  and the Rio Declaration emphasize on the right to human life in "harmony with nature."  The Rio Declaration acknowledges procedural rights, including public participation, access to justice, and the right to information regarding the environment.  The integration of environmental well-being into human rights is apparent through the focus on "living conditions" and the "highest attainable standard of physical and mental health"  in the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR). International human rights and environmental frameworks have made subtle indications of the nexus between human rights and the environment. However, until recently, they had not integrated the two in close tandem. A distinct discourse on greening human rights emerged with the United Nations General Assembly Resolution on the Human Right to a Safe, Clean, Healthy, and Sustainable Environment.  This acknowledgment emphasizes the necessity of environmental well-being in enjoying all human rights. The resolution on human rights and climate change further substantiates this effort by recognizing the effects of climate change on human rights.  It elaborates on the interference of environmental harm with human rights, particularly in case of the vulnerable population,  establishing a linkage between human rights and the environment. 
The recognizing and implementation of these established and emerging international norms regarding the environment and human rights is essential for their protection. Domestic application plays a vital role in this realization. Strengthening domestic legal and institutional mechanisms is a way and in light of this, the role of domestic courts in implementing rights become crucial. South Asia, with its strong judiciaries, including Nepal, provides an interesting perspective. 
IV.	Mapping the Judicial Footsteps of Nepal 
Following the change brought about by the position of the Court in the 1990 Constitution, the Supreme Court of Nepal has emerged as an essential locus of constitutional development.  It has interpreted constitutional provisions, reviewed the constitutionality of legislative enactments, and delivered landmark decisions on cases regarding the formation and operation of government and the parliament.  The Court has also intervened in areas such as inclusion,  education,  employment,  disability,  health and security issues,  starvation and calamities,  senior citizens and single mothers,  and the alleviation of the woes of vulnerable groups such as Dalits , Badis , Kamlaris , Halias  and Kamaiyas.   Due to social and structural barriers, these groups consistently find themselves at the bottom in fundamental aspects such as education, health, wealth, employment, life expectancy, and participation in state structures.  The Court's concern about freeing people from bondage of exploitative practices and bringing them into the mainstream is apparent from the following observation made in the Halia case.
"…. It is quite shameful to say that people, even in the 21st century, get exploited in the name of customs, religion and other pretexts, or that they are crushed by loans, work as bonded laborers in lieu of a parcel of land given to them for tilling; they live half starved, their children deprived of education and basic health facilities. Even to say that such a practice exists is a matter of national shame. It goes against the principle of an egalitarian society that the Constitution aspires to establish." 
Following the inclusive dimension of the 2015 Constitution providing for the right to social justice  and group-specific fundamental rights,  the Court has emphasized the alleviation and mainstreaming of Dalit and other marginalized communities on an inclusive basis. It has directed amendments to relevant legislation,  identified the target population for such measures, and directed for the allocation of necessary resources ensured through affirmative actions.  It has also directed concerned agencies to facilitate meaningful participation of marginalized communities in decision-making processes. 
Regarding environmental rights, the Godavari Marble case (petition filed in 1992)  marks a turning point. The Supreme Court of Nepal interpreted right to live in a clean environment as intrinsic to the right to life guaranteed by the 1990 Constitution. Since then, the judiciary has increasingly recognized the human rights concerns of environmental harm and climate change. This has resulted in the heightened safeguarding of rights, and special protection of marginalized populations who are most affected by environmental and climatic harm. The Supreme Court has applied the principle of respecting, protecting, and fulfilling human rights to ensure a safe, clean, healthy, and sustainable environment , establishing a reciprocal relationship between the two. Over time, the Court has handed down decisions in areas such as pollution control , management of solid waste,  use of plastic,  management of pesticides,  and land use and planning.  In these cases, the Court has taken a human rights perspective while addressing the environmental harm caused by state and non-state actors. While a detailed discussion is beyond the scope of this paper, this section highlights representative cases concerning the right to clean and healthy environment , and environmentally sustainable development.  
Safeguarding Forests and Protected Areas  
The court has focused on the protection of biodiversity by checking rampant felling of forests,  protecting community forests, ensuring equitable rights in use and management of community forest  and protected species,  and protecting lakes and other water bodies. 
In the past three decades, Nepal has made considerable progress in protecting forests and biodiversity through the community forest programs. The country’s forests now cover nearly 44 percent of its land, owing much to the community forest (CF) program initiated by the government in the 1980s and 1990s.  The work of environmental defenders  in rural Nepal is a contributing factor to the increase in forest cover. These community forest defenders are organized by forming community forestry user groups (CFUGs), which are 22,415 in number and comprise 2.9 million households. They protect more than 2.3 million hectares of forest.  
Income generation is a prime motive for the CF program. The Forest Act, 1992 made provisions for the rational allocation of the income for CF development, poverty alleviation, women empowerment, and development of local enterprises.  This was a significant shift in the country's environmental governance, and led to wide-scale forest rejuvenation.  However, the CF program is also facing challenges such as unplanned infrastructure development projects, illegal quarrying, and out-migration and transition of people from agriculture to other occupations.  
Although the law guarantees autonomy to CFUGs in managing the revenue generated from community forest management, the government's persistent attempts to divert a large portion of this income to its own coffers remain a significant issue.  The CFUGs already pay both income tax and value added tax (VAT) to the federal government, as well as taxes to local governments on the income generated from forest produce sales. In the fiscal year 2022/23, all seven provincial governments imposed further tax ranging from 15 to 40 percent.  Given the potential impact of such taxation on forest conservation, the Supreme Court issued an interim order to stop the provincial governments from collecting such additional taxes.  The order, although interim in nature, provided relief to the CFUGs.  
National parks and protected areas are another priority area for forests and biodiversity conservation.  Nepal now hosts 20 protected areas covering 23.39 percent of its land area, contributing to in-situ ecosystem conservation and biodiversity protection.  However, establishing national parks and conservation areas alongside human settlements has surfaced several challenges. Encroachment in and around the national park's forest and buffer zone areas impedes  protection efforts in Nepal.  One such challenge has been the construction of roads threatening the biodiversity and ecosystem of Chitwan  and Bardia National Park.  
The Court issued orders to halt the construction of roads that pass through the parks.  In  Chitwan National Park, the Court discarded the principle of parens patrie, which designates the state as the owner of natural resources. Instead, it advocated for the government to act as a trustee in protecting natural resources and biodiversity for both the present and future generations.  In Bardiya National Park, the Court ruled that project alternatives that have minimum impact on environment should be prioritized keeping in mind the principles of sustainable development.  
1.	Protection of the Churia Region
Churia (also called Shiwalik or Chure) is the southernmost hill range of the Himalaya system. It spreads around 800 kilometers east-west dimension in Nepal and extends to the north-west and north-east India.  This range is chiefly composed of sandstone and poorly consolidated rock formations. The Churia region spreads into 36 districts of Nepal and occupies almost 12.78 percent of Nepal's land area.  One hundred sixty four river systems originate or cross from this region. Unsystematic excavation and export of river bed materials (sand, gravel, stones) exacerbated by haphazard settlement, exploitation of the forest resources, unsustainable farming system, open pasturage, forest fire, and environmentally unfriendly infrastructures have significantly impacted the lives of the people in this ecologically sensitive region. 
Former President of Nepal Dr. Ram Baran Yadav initiated an attempt to protect Churia in 2007-08 through the formation of the ‘President Churia-Terai Madhesh Conservation and Development Committee’.  The initiation resulted in some progress on Churia conservation, but the situation has not proven substantial. The relentless excavation of stone, gravel, and sand from rivers has led to adverse effects such as widening of the riverbed, bank erosion, loss of agricultural land in the adjoining areas and disasters including flood and landslide.  This has posed a threat to the lives and livelihoods of people in Churia, Bhavar, and the Terai region. Recognizing the environmental threat arising from sand and gravel mining in Churia and mindful of previous judicial efforts that failed to halt the exploitation,  the Supreme Court, in the case of Sailendra Ambedkar, took a bold step to stop the plundering of Churia.  It held that environmentally sustainable development is the "most fundamental"  among state policies, just as the Constitution's guarantee of the right to a dignified life is the most fundamental among fundamental rights. Rejecting the politically toned submission of the government that export of riverbed materials was necessary for meeting revenue deficit in trade with India, the Court observed:
"Recovering revenue through the export of stones, gravel, and sand … for economic or political interest is beneficial neither for the current nor for the future generation. Massively exploiting nature by extracting large quantities of stones and gravel is unacceptable. Such actions create an image in the mind, like selling the bones and flesh of one's mother for monetary gains. Doing so amounts to ecocide. To prevent this, we should all work together to protect our mountains, hills, and rivers and keep them clean and healthy. Nature is the gift we got from our ancestors to pass on to our descendants. We must never forget intergenerational justice and equity. This is also the fiduciary duty of the state. Therefore, while using nature, utmost caution should be taken. The human right of the people to live in a clean and healthy environment guaranteed by the Constitution, and the policy of environmental sustainable development depends on this. No one has the right to abuse nature-leaving it barren and damaged where it can never return to its original form… by showing reasons of revenue deficit. Rather, the focus should be on identifying the cause for such revenue deficit and making up for it through the sustainable use of biological diversity and renewable energy development." 
This judgment is significant because it held that the destruction of the diverse biodiversity and human population of the Churia region would lead to the destruction of the whole country.  The court deemed the government's planning of excavation, neglecting its own commitments  and the Court’s precedent , leading to widespread environmental harm, as ecocide. The Court held that humans, as a part of the nature, have no right to act recklessly against the nature causing its irreversible decimation. Thus, it banned the export of riverbed materials from the region until the Parliament deliberated the matter and enacted a law allowing such exports.
2.	Protection of Water Bodies and Lakes
The protection of rivers, lakes, and water bodies has been on the judicial radar since the 1990s. The Supreme Court has issued orders for addressing river pollution and the mismanagement of ponds, wetlands, and lakes.  A prominent case in this regard concerns the protection of the second-largest lake in Nepal - the Fewa Lake, against urbanization-led encroachment. This lake, which spanned 10.35 square kilometers in 1961, had shrunk by almost half  when petitioners filed the case in 2018. Besides, there were issues affecting the beauty of the lake. A large number of oddly constructed hotels and other infrastructures around the periphery has diminished its natural appeal. Excessive growth of aquatic algae and weeds, and solid waste, pollution, and muddy discharge brought to the lake by its tributaries have degraded its visual aesthetic.  Through a series of orders, the Court halted the construction of cable cars passing through the lake and its periphery, and asked the government to protect the lake and the biodiversity in and around it.  More recently, the Court quashed the decision of the concerned municipality to shrink the set back to 30 meters and issued an order of mandamus for removing any construction in the periphery for up to 65 meters from the bank of the lake. The Court also asked the government to develop the cleared area as a buffer zone.  
3.	Ravage by Wild Animals and Compensation for Harm
Often, conflict arises between the local people and authorities of the protected areas when wild animals ravage crops and attack domestic animals and humans. In Bajuddin Miya, farmers who suffered huge agricultural losses caused by wild animals from the Koshi Tappu wildlife reserve filed a petition in the Court when no state body compensated them.  The petitioners sought compensation for damages caused to their crops by wild animals including elephants, deer, and badgers. The Court found the state tortiously liable for the injury caused to the people by wild animals. It observed that if an animal inside a reserve causes damage to crops or other harm to farming households, the State should compensate the victim as the keeper of such an animal.  Building on Bajuddin Miya, in Thakur Subedi, the Court took cognizance of the economic impact of crop damage on farmers' livelihoods and asked the government to include monkey-induced crop damage in the existing relief guidelines and pay compensation to affected farmers.  This judgment has established a foundational precedent for ensuring the “protection, empowerment and development” of vulnerable farmers - a protected group under the 2015 Constitution.  It also broadened the enforceability of the right to receive compensation for environmental harm by extending protection to farmers as both a human rights obligation and a liability for environmental harm. 
4.	Plastic Control and Waste Management in Mountain Areas
Plastic control is another area where the Court has played a substantive role by directing measures to curb pollution and mitigate environmental and public health risks. In Plastic Producers the Court upheld the government's contested decision to ban plastics below the thickness of 40 microns in Kathmandu valley, factoring in the indefinite harm of unregulated plastic use on public health, biodiversity, and climate.   Despite this decision, the government in 2022 reduced the approved ban from 40 microns to less than 30 microns.  This reversal lead to another petition concerning plastic ban, filed before the Court in 2018. In the latter petition, the Court highlighted the principle of "in dubio pro natura"  and quashed the government’s decision, holding the reversal as taking a step back from the existing pollution control standards. This case highlighted the need for a human rights-sensitive approach to environment protection emphasizing on the linkage between environmental harm and public health. It also addressed the effects of unmanaged plastic use, including degradation of soil quality and water pollution, which disproportionately impact vulnerable communities such as marginalized groups and farmers who rely on agriculture and natural resources for their livelihoods. 
Despite the country earning revenue from expeditions and trekking in the mountains, waste management in the mountain areas, such as the Mount Everest, has been quite challenging. In Deepak Bikram seeking government initiatives to clean the mountains, the Court delved into the question of potential threat posed by reckless littering during expeditions.  Guided by the precautionary and polluter pay principles, the Court, issued an interim order directing the government to conduct studies and prepare reports providing information on expedition permits, responsibilities of the tourists, and ways of managing human waste and deceased bodies discovered in the mountains. 
5.	Calamities, Disasters, and Mitigation Efforts 
In developed nations, discussions about climate change primarily concerns carbon emissions, their reduction and carbon trade. Conversely, the discourse in developing countries often relates to disasters, calamities, diseases, fire, loss of agricultural production, and drying up of water systems, and their severe impact on vulnerable communities.  A prime example of such concerns in Nepal is the 2007 mass starvation in the Midwestern mountain areas caused by a shortfall in food production. The scarcity of basic medicine further aggravated this. In a petition seeking government action for relief in this matter, the Court called upon the state to fulfill its obligation of preventing starvation and ensuring the basic necessity of the right to food and its access. It ordered the government to supply food and medicines to the people in affected districts even if it required importing food supplies.  In Bhupendra Thing concerning the distribution of rotten rice as relief material after the 2015 earthquake, the Court interpreted the right to food to include access to nutritious and quality food.  It reminded international agencies like the World Food Program to bear this in mind and provide only high-quality, nutritious food when distributing relief.   
Destruction of settlements by fire occurs almost yearly in the rural Terai of Nepal. One such instance is the Raksharam Harijan, case where recurring fire caused by dry weather and vernacular housings in western Terai was brought to the cognizance of the Court.   Here, the Court emphasized the impact of fire-induced disasters on marginalized communities, specifically those living in thatched houses in the rural areas of Terai. It highlighted the necessity of integrating disaster management into settlement development, educational facilities, healthcare infrastructure, and environmental projects. It called on the government to develop national housing and food storage standards, focusing on marginalized populations compelled to live in hazardous conditions due to financial constraints . The Court asked the government to establish comprehensive arrangements for disaster management with focus on the development of climate-friendly housing and settlement projects. The Court also reminded the state of its commitments towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the Paris Convention, and its ratification of the Sendai Framework. 
In Amarnath Jha addressing the yearly floods occurring in Terai, the Court emphasized the need of human rights perspective on climate change.  Recognizing climate change as a primary cause of floods, the Court, in light of environment, climate change, and human rights law, thoughtfully observed that "the right of people to live in a healthy and safe environment should be respected in every possible way and Courts should protect the people from the effects of flood and landslides. Thus, when the government fails to discharge its obligations to protect the rights of disaster-affected people and communities, the Court has to pave the way for judicial activism."  It stressed that constitutional rights are not just declarations, and the state must effectively implement them. In this case, the Court directed the state to adopt a sustainable development approach in all programs and policies, ensuring accountability. Additionally, it urged the government to implement a multifaceted strategy incorporating science and technology to formulate long-term solutions for disaster risk mitigation in the context of climate change. 
6.	Climate Change and the Court
Climate change has been a persistent issue, resulting in massive loss of snow cover in the Himalaya, the bursting of glacial lakes, and floods downstream, all of which severely affect the lives and livelihoods of millions. In his visit to Nepal, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres made the following remarks when he addressed the Nepali parliament on Oct 31st, 2023: 
"What is happening in this country as a result of climate change is an appalling injustice and a searing indictment of the fossil fuel age. I am deeply concerned by those communities in Nepal facing the brutal impacts of the climate crisis. … Nepal is a friend to the world. The world must be a better friend to Nepal. The United Nations will never stop fighting to make that a reality." 
To fight the climate crisis, Nepal issued a Climate Change Policy in 2010.  However, there was no binding law to address this issue. Regarding this lack of legislation, Padam Shrestha demanded the government to enact a climate-specific law.  The Court observed that the state has a responsibility to adapt and mitigate climate change by protecting the environment. Failure of the government to address climate adequately violates the rights to a dignified life and a healthy environment guaranteed in the Constitution of Nepal, and is in violation of Nepal's commitments under the Paris Agreement.  It ruled that a new law was necessary to implement Nepal's commitments under the Paris Agreement and in accordance with the state obligations mentioned in the Constitution. The Court further directed for effective implementation of the Climate Change Policy, 2010, the National Adaptation Program of Action, 2010, and the National Framework for Local Adaptation Plan for Action, 2011 until the parliament drafts a climate-specific legislation.  Following this decision, a new Environment Protection Act, 2019 replaced the Environment Protection Act, 1997. The new law contains provisions on compensation for environmental harm and a distinct chapter on climate change mitigation.  
7.	Development and Human Rights Accountability 
In matters concerning infrastructure development projects, the Court has given particular emphasis to the environment and human rights dimensions. It consistently highlights the importance of sustainable development, and ecological and human sensitivity in such projects. Though sometimes presumed as being anti-development, the Court maintains a balanced approach  that strongly opposes overlooking environmental factors ensuring that infrastructure development proceeds responsibly without neglecting these critical aspects.
A case that expounds on ecologically sustainable development is Upper Karnali. In this case, the Constitutional Bench stated, "the rivers, land, forests, biological diversity, and natural resources in the country are invaluable assets for the people. These assets must be utilized per the concept of environmentally sustainable development outlined in the Constitution. The government serves as the trustee of public interest and should consistently act in the national interest based on public policy."  The court did not issue a binding mandamus in this case and allowed the project to proceed. However, taking an integrated approach to human rights and environmental protection, the Court felt it necessary to acknowledge the significant contribution of local communities in maintaining the watershed safe despite the livelihood challenges posed by climate change, such as shrinking land productivity and other adversities. Recognizing the right of people to benefit from a hydropower project in their vicinity, the Court urged the government to allocate a portion of the project's annual revenue for spending on areas such as education, health, and overall economic and social development within the watershed area. The Court considered this amount also as payment for the ecosystem service the local people have been providing by preserving the watershed.  Subsequent decision of Bigyan Singh Bista has followed this notion of payment for ecosystem service.  These decisions hope to contribute in enhancing the government's human rights accountability and alleviate the pain of marginalization of the people living in the mountain areas.
 
V.	Overview of the Constitutional and Judicial Exercise
The Constitution premised on the access to justice model, designates the Supreme Court of Nepal as its guardian. It grants the Court the jurisdiction to look into all the chambers of the Constitution.  This model allows public-spirited citizens and human rights advocates to draw the court's attention to human rights violations caused by executive or legislative inaction or mis-action. The Constitution mandates the Court to provide appropriate remedies on such issues promoting the culture of judicial activism. Over time, the Supreme Court has made seminal contributions to human rights and environmental governance matters. 
Since the unveiling of the new constitution in 2015, Nepal has entered a phase of the inclusive consolidation of rights. The judiciary has been at the forefront of this. Inclusion, now as the signature tone of the Constitution, is visible in the organization of the state and the arrangement of rights. The Court has grounded its rulings on promoting community forestry, advocating for environmental impact assessments with public participation, and supporting ecosystem services within the notion of inclusivity for the local population. While Nepal grapples with environmental challenges, some of which exceed its capacity to address, the constitutional framework emphasizes on environmentally sustainable development. It prioritizes inclusive and equitable dynamics focusing mostly on vulnerable individuals and communities such as Haliya, Dalit, Kamaiya etc. who are at the bottom of the socio-economic ladder. This is a prominent message of the discussion, which the world should recognize.
Nepal’s message to the world is to be deduced from the way it is handling matters that the global environmental law regime often overlooks. The absence of specific regulations for mountain ecosystems such as the Himalaya exemplifies this oversight. The ongoing and potential impacts of climate change on Nepal's mountains and its people, especially the vulnerable communities, present distinctive issues for the country. Nepal's efforts to preserve its environment from climate change are a story the nation wants to share with the world. The world must understand the challenges faced by Nepal as a Himalayan nation. Observing how Nepal addresses these challenges involving complex elements of human rights and the environment such as keeping mountains clean, safeguarding the rich biodiversity and human inhabitants of the mountain ranges like the Churia, and addressing human-wildlife conflicts, through the application of  domestic and international laws provides valuable insights. 
From establishing environmental protection as a fundamental right in its court rulings to formulating guidelines for safeguarding mountain regions and evolving the concept of ecocide as state practice, Nepal is setting a precedent for other jurisdictions to follow. Nepal's stance on viewing environmental challenges through a human rights lens predates international recognition, exemplified by the 1990 Godawari Marble case.  This human rights and environment nexus has been extended to issues such as protecting forests  and national parks , mountain ranges,  and prioritizing people-centered development with direct payback mechanisms for ecosystem services.  In addressing longstanding issues like development versus the environment, the Court has centered sustainability at the core of environment protection. The Court, in numerous cases have recognized sustainability not just as a provision but also as an essence of the Constitution.  
The analysis if cases show that Nepal is addressing its unique concerns with practical solutions, drawing from both domestic and international laws. By recognizing emerging concepts, Nepal is also shaping state practice in the international environmental framework. Nepal’s courts have actively incorporated international norms into their judgments, serving as a conduit for the application of these norms. As international law lacks its own enforcement mechanism, the role of domestic court in the application of international law is pivotal. 
Nepal also serves as a case study on how legal opportunities and rights empower people for effective environmental governance. The resilience of community forest and buffer zone forest management systems is established by the fact that they survived through the Maoist insurgency (1996-2006).  In the post-conflict era, ongoing judicial interventions, such as providing relief to CFUGs from burdensome taxes, reflect continued efforts.  Nepal has made considerable progress in generating clean energy and increasing forest cover in recent times. However, the challenge lies in effectively and sustainably implementing court judgments. 
Despite constitutional guarantees and judicial efforts, analysis of case laws on environmental and natural resource management reveal varying levels of non-compliance and instances of regression from compliance. Petitioners have had to bring, certain cases such as cases concerning the Chure, Fewa Lake protection, and limitations on plastic, multiple times before the court because government and business communities have disregarded the judgments after a certain period.  Consequently, the court has had to reissue similar orders. Although there is no outright defiance, this pattern and the government's tendency to backtrack over time reflects a lack of genuine interest and sustained commitment to environmental protection.   This calls for regular judicial vigilance. 
The greatest issue facing Nepal today is the impact of climate change. As General Secretary Guterres said, "Nepal is facing the brutal impacts of the climate crisis," which is an existential threat to the populace.  The carbon emissions in the neighborhood and beyond victimize Nepal despite minimal contribution. This has contributed in many environmental and human rights harms as well. Despite positive human rights and environmental governance efforts, Nepal cannot mitigate climate change and its impacts with its efforts alone. International visibility of Nepal's environmental concerns and support in mitigating them are therefore paramount for the country to effectively address these challenges, which are also global in nature. This support can help Nepal implement sustainable practices, enhance resilience to climate change, and protect its valuable natural resources.
Conclusion
The Nepali Supreme Court has enforced fundamental rights and inclusivity, and applied principles of international environment and human rights law. When met with occasional defiance from the government, the Court has consistently urged adherence to its domestic and international obligations. Through such decisions, Nepal wishes to convey notions of sustainability, environmental inclusivity, and human rights. The efforts made by domestic courts in struggling democracies, such as Nepal, present significant case studies revealing how international human rights and environmental laws can find realization through domestic endeavors. They deserve acknowledgment and in-depth discussions. 
While Nepal is on the path of ensuring inclusivity and human rights, it grapples with numerous environmental challenges. Nepal's narrative centers on the disproportionate effects it experiences in the changing global environmental and climatic scenario. It seeks to draw global notice to these impacts in light of its geographical, ecological, and social backdrop. Nepal has actively addressed longstanding global issues and unique, emerging problems despite challenges, through legal and judicial measures. The creative role its courts play warrants more attention. Nepal has taken a multi-pronged strategy in addressing challenges that its people face. These wide-ranging efforts merit global recognition. The way Nepali judiciary approaches environmental concerns, rooted in inclusivity and human rights, serves as an example for the world to deeply understand and strongly support.
